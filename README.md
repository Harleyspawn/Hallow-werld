Gotta start somewhere

This is where the journey begins. It's interesting to see how GitHub works. Knowledge is power, power corrupts, so absolute knowledge would corrupt absolutely, right?

So, the idea of SourceForge is that I can load a local copy of this file on my computer, futz around with it in my own editor and toolset,
and then SourceForge will push it back into the cloud as a new branch? 

Do I have to tell SourceForge to figure out that I've edited the files, or will it know just by comparing to the ones in the cloud?

Do I have to tell SourceForge to make a new branch when I start editing the local copy of files, or will it automatically make a new branch when it notices there's an edited file?

Let's find out.

I used the Naked-Snake branch to add some fonts to be used later.
